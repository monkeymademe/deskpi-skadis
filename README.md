This is a modular system built for smaller print beds that when put together replace the acrylic walls of the T1 RackMate from Deskpi/52pi.

The sections interlock so that when putting sideways pressure you don't end up pushing a single tile into the rack and at least for my T1 everything is snug and fitting exactly so there is no rattling around.

I will be working on the other sizes of RackMates as soon as I get the measurements. Only the bottom section would need adjustments technically. The middle and top would stay the same in theory.
